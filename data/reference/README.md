# README.md `reference`

This folder would contain data downloaded from other sources, and not generated directly during the project, for example:

- NCBI sequence files
- transcriptome data from GEO
- data generated in a different project

Different categories of data, or data from different sources might be stored in suitably-named subfolders, e.g.

```bash
.
├── README.md
├── ncbi_genomes
└── rcsb_structures
```
