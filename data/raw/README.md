# README.md `raw`

This folder would hold the original raw data as it was collected, such as:

- sequence read files (e.g. `fastq`)
- .csv with manually added data for the db to read in sql-alchemy

Different categories of data, or data collected on different dates or for different samples might be stored in suitably-named subfolders, e.g.by table type in the BMC db
