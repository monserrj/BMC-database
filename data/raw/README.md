# README.md `raw`

This folder would hold the original raw data as it was collected, such as:

- sequence read files (e.g. `fastq`)
- mass spectrometry trace files
- original survey data

Different categories of data, or data collected on different dates or for different samples might be stored in suitably-named subfolders, e.g.

```bash
