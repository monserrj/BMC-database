# README.md `assets`

This subfolder contains _assets_. These are resources that are useful at the top level of the repository _but not necessarily part of your scientific work_, such as:

- images for the `README.md` file
- documents or other files you might want to link from the `README.md` file, especially if you are using GitHub pages from the main repository root

The intent behind this subfolder is that it collects a number of miscellaneous files together by the _way they are used_. The particular way they are used is that they are _assets_ to support some other presentation, like a document or a webpage. The `assets` folder is further subdivided by document type, for ease of navigation, and efficient organisation.

For instance, in the template repository, we have an `images` subfolder. This contains images that are useful for the `README` file in the repository root. Images in this folder can be linked from the `README.md` in the repository root with the `Markdown` code below, to display the image on the landing page.

```markdown
![This is the image caption and alt-text](./assets/images/<FILENAME>)
```

For example, the first image in the README is linked using the code below

```markdown
![Location of the `Use This Template` button on the GitHub repository page](./assets/images/use_this_template_button.png)
```

Other assets can be linked in a similar way. Please see the links below for further guidance on linking items from a Markdown document.
