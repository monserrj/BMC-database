# README.md `BMC database`

Space designed to create the Bacterial microcompartment database. This database is being designed with the objective of facilitating access to BMC protein information for research purposes. Proteins include both structural proteins (e.g.: hexamers) and proteins with other functions that are part of the bacterial microcompartment, such as a chaperone or signature enzyme
