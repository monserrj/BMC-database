    "# Controlled vocabulary\n",
    "The Microcompartment Database uses a controlled vocabulary to ensure consistency and accuracy in data entry and retrieval. This vocabulary includes standardised terms and definitions for various aspects of microcompartments, such as types, functions, and associated proteins. By adhering to this controlled vocabulary, users can effectively search and analyse the database, facilitating better communication and understanding within the scientific community."
